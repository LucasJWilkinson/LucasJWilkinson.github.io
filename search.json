    "text": "The 2022 MLB season contained a new postseason platform. MLB expanded the bracket to allow one more wild-card team from each league. This means that six teams from the National League will make the postseason. The two teams with the best record received a first-round bye, and the other four teams faced off in a three-game series to advance to the next round.\nThe National League East was a highlighted division entering the 2022 Major League Baseball season, because of the expected competition to arise throughout the season. The Atlanta Braves were World Series champions in the season prior. The New York Mets loaded up with talent over the offseason, and the Philadelphia Phillies signed Kyle Schwarber and Nick Castellanos to multi-year deals. Spoiler alert, all three teams made the postseason.\nThe Phillies roster was the sixth highest payroll in the 2022 season, however they got off to a 22-29 start through their first 51 games. This led to the Phillies firing manager Joe Girardi, and putting the team in the hands of Rob Thompson. The Phillies record under Thompson was 65-46.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nNLStandings <- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC 350 - Fall 2022/NationalLeagueStandings2.csv\") %>%\n  filter(Rk > 0 )\n\nmlb_hitting <- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC 350 - Fall 2022/MLB-HITTING.csv\") \nmlb_pitching <- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC 350 - Fall 2022/mlb-pitching.csv\")\ncombined <- mlb_hitting %>% inner_join(mlb_pitching, by = c(\"Tm\", \"G\"))\n\nSimpleStandings <- NLStandings %>% \n  select(Tm, W, L, GB)\n\nStandings <- NLStandings %>% \n  separate(\"500\", into=c(\"Wins\", \"Losses\"), sep=\"-\") \n\nChartData <- Standings %>% \n  select(\n    Tm, W, Wins\n  ) %>% mutate(Wins = as.numeric(Wins)) %>%\n  rename(`Total Wins` = W, `Quality Wins` = Wins) %>%\n  mutate(Wins = `Total Wins` - `Quality Wins`) %>%\n  select(Tm, Wins, `Quality Wins`)\n\nChartData %>% \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=-Tm, \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"Total\") -> Stacked\n\nph <- mlb_hitting %>% filter(Tm == \"Philadelphia Phillies\")\npi <- mlb_pitching %>% filter(Tm == \"Philadelphia Phillies\")\nphils <- combined %>% filter(Tm == \"Philadelphia Phillies\")\n\nSimpleStandings %>% \n  gt() %>% \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"The Phillies were a mid-tier National League team in the 2022 regular season\",\n    subtitle = \"Philadelphia played just good enough to make the playoffs\"\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n)%>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) %>%\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Lucas Wilkinson  |  **Source:** [Sports Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/2022-standings.shtml)\")\n  ) %>%\ntab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) %>%\n  opt_row_striping() %>% \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") %>%\n\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#002D72\"), \n      cell_text(color = \"#E81828\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Tm == \"Philadelphia Phillies\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      The Phillies were a mid-tier National League team in the 2022 regular season\n    \n    \n      Philadelphia played just good enough to make the playoffs\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Tm\n      W\n      L\n      GB\n    \n  \n  \n    Los Angeles Dodgers\n111\n51\n+24.0\n    Atlanta Braves\n101\n61\n+14.0\n    New York Mets\n101\n61\n+14.0\n    St. Louis Cardinals\n93\n69\n+6.0\n    San Diego Padres\n89\n73\n+2.0\n    Philadelphia Phillies\n87\n75\n--\n    Milwaukee Brewers\n86\n76\n1.0\n    San Francisco Giants\n81\n81\n6.0\n    Chicago Cubs\n74\n88\n13.0\n    Arizona Diamondbacks\n74\n88\n13.0\n    Miami Marlins\n69\n93\n18.0\n    Colorado Rockies\n68\n94\n19.0\n    Cincinnati Reds\n62\n100\n25.0\n    Pittsburgh Pirates\n62\n100\n25.0\n    Washington Nationals\n55\n107\n32.0\n  \n  \n    \n      By: Lucas Wilkinson  |  Source: Sports Reference\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nThe Phillies limped into the postseason this year as the sixth seed in the playoffs. The standings visually show how close the race was. However, the Phillies were not really a hot team to end the season. They went 7-13 in their last 20 games, and lost the last two games of the season. The Phillies finished 3rd place in the NL East.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=Stacked, \n    aes(x=reorder(Tm,Total), weight=Total, fill=Type)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#002D72\", \"#E81828\")) + \n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Total Wins\", \n    title=\"Phillies did not beat many quality \\nteams in the regular season.\", \n    subtitle=\"Philadelphia was near the bottom of the National League vs. teams >.500\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Lucas Wilkinson\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\" , \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8, face =\"bold\"), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank() \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Phillies also were not beating many teams above .500. I classified those wins as quality wins. Philadelphia was 34-47 against quality teams. I am still unsure how they were so bad against good teams until they reached the playoffs.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=combined, aes(x=ERA, y=BA)) +\n    geom_point(data=phils, aes(x=ERA, y=BA), color=\"#E81828\") +\n  coord_flip()+ \n  \n  geom_point(data=phils, aes(x=`ERA`, y=`BA`), color=\"#E81828\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=phils, aes(x=`ERA`, y=`BA`, label=\"Phillies\")) +\n    \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 3.96) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = .243) +\n  \n   labs(\n    x=\"ERA\", \n    y=\"Offensive Batting Average\", \n    title=\"Philadelphia was average in team ERA, \\nnot amazing at hitting.\", \n    subtitle=\"The Phillies had an okay regular season in many aspects.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Lucas Wilkinson\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10) \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nI correlated team ERA (pitching) and offensive batting average to see how Philadelphia matched up against every MLB team over the season. The black lines are league averages. The Phillies were right at average for team ERA, and just above the league average for team batting average. These stats are not the only way to define an offense and defense, but they are a good starting point.\nThe NLCS contained the fifth and sixth seeded teams. I don’t believe this should happen often, and if MLB wants to stay relevant they need their best teams playing late in the postseason. The 162 game season is starting to seem outdated. I believe the MLB should rethink either the regular season platform, or the postseason platform."

Due to Carter having an injury, and being a catcher, he only played in 132 games in the regular season. If Carter had the chance to step up to the plate as much as Hernandez,he would have been able to out-produce him in the rbi category by a long-shot.\nClaiming a player is better just because they produce more rbi’s than the other is a unfair to Keith Hernandez. Hernandez’s role on the team was to hit for a high average and get on base so the other players could bat him in.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=ValuedStats, \n    aes(y=reorder(Name, WAR), x=WAR, xend=dWAR),\n    size = 1,\n    color = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"#002D72\",\n    colour_xend = \"#FF5910\") + \n  labs(\n    x=\"WAR\", \n    y=\"\", \n    title=\"Keith Hernandez aquired the highest \\nWAR in the regular season.\", \n    subtitle=\"Lenny Dykstra is surprisingly the next highest on the list\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Lucas Wilkinson\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n    theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\" , \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10,) \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe orange dot on the graph represents defensive WAR, while the blue dot represents a player’s total WAR. Keith Hernandez acquired the highest total WAR on the team, and Lenny Dykstra somehow totaled a higher WAR than Gary Carter and Daryl Strawberry in the 1986 season.\nOther notable takeaways from this graph are that Daryl Strawberry had a negative defensive WAR, but made up for it with his bat. Rafael Santana is the only player to have a higher defensive WAR than total WAR, which is hard to accomplish.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=Pitching, aes(x=IP, y=ERA)) +\n    geom_point(data=Doc, aes(x=IP, y=ERA), color=\"#002D72\") +\n  coord_flip()+ \n  \n  geom_point(data=Doc, aes(x=`IP`, y=`ERA`), color=\"#FF5910\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=Doc, aes(x=`IP`, y=`ERA`, label=\"Dwight Gooden\")) +\n  \n  geom_point(data=Bob, aes(x=`IP`, y=`ERA`), color=\"#FF5910\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=Bob, aes(x=`IP`, y=`ERA`, label=\"Bob Ojeda\")) +\n  \n  geom_point(data=Jesse, aes(x=`IP`, y=`ERA`), color=\"#FF5910\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=Jesse, aes(x=`IP`, y=`ERA`, label=\"Jesse Orosco\")) +\n    \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 98.9333333) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 3.11) +\n  geom_text(aes(y=1, x=150, label=\"Good ERA, High Usage\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(y=5, x=50, label=\"Bad ERA, Low Usage\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  \n  labs(\n    x=\"Innings Pitched\", \n    y=\"Earned Run Average\", \n    title=\"Dwight Gooden was a shell of his 1985 self.\", \n    subtitle=\"One can argue that Ojeda had a better year on the bump\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Lucas Wilkinson\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.title.position = \"plot\" , \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10,) \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1986 New York Mets would not have been a great team if their pitching wasn’t at least decent. The Mets staff featured Dwight Gooden, Ron Darling and Bob Ojeda. Dwight Gooden won the CY Young award in 1985 with one of the best pitching seasons ever, but he could not keep that pace in the 1986 season. Ojeda arguably had a better regular season than the rest of the staff, but Gooden still had the most innings pitched and the most wins out of any pitcher on the staff.\nEvery player had a role on the team. Keith Hernandez was a defensive guru, Mookie Wilson had the speed the team needed, Daryl Strawberry was the star hitter for the Mets, and Lenny Dykstra was a hard-knock who would do anything for the team to win. Overall, I believe that Gary Carter had the best season on the 1986 Mets. Carter’s ability to play the hardest position in the field, while also having the highest totals in some of the most important hitting stats was impressive."
