    "text": "The 2022 MLB season contained a new postseason platform. MLB expanded the bracket to allow one more wild-card team from each league. This means that six teams from the National League will make the postseason. The two teams with the best record received a first-round bye, and the other four teams faced off in a three-game series to advance to the next round.\nThe National League East was a highlighted division entering the 2022 Major League Baseball season, because of the expected competition to arise throughout the season. The Atlanta Braves were World Series champions in the season prior. The New York Mets loaded up with talent over the offseason, and the Philadelphia Phillies signed Kyle Schwarber and Nick Castellanos to multi-year deals. Spoiler alert, all three teams made the postseason.\nThe Phillies roster was the sixth highest payroll in the 2022 season, however they got off to a 22-29 start through their first 51 games. This led to the Phillies firing manager Joe Girardi, and putting the team in the hands of Rob Thompson. The Phillies record under Thompson was 65-46.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nNLStandings <- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC 350 - Fall 2022/NationalLeagueStandings2.csv\") %>%\n  filter(Rk > 0 )\n\nmlb_hitting <- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC 350 - Fall 2022/MLB-HITTING.csv\") \nmlb_pitching <- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC 350 - Fall 2022/mlb-pitching.csv\")\ncombined <- mlb_hitting %>% inner_join(mlb_pitching, by = c(\"Tm\", \"G\"))\n\nSimpleStandings <- NLStandings %>% \n  select(Tm, W, L, GB)\n\nStandings <- NLStandings %>% \n  separate(\"500\", into=c(\"Wins\", \"Losses\"), sep=\"-\") \n\nChartData <- Standings %>% \n  select(\n    Tm, W, Wins\n  ) %>% mutate(Wins = as.numeric(Wins)) %>%\n  rename(`Total Wins` = W, `Quality Wins` = Wins) %>%\n  mutate(Wins = `Total Wins` - `Quality Wins`) %>%\n  select(Tm, Wins, `Quality Wins`)\n\nChartData %>% \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=-Tm, \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"Total\") -> Stacked\n\nph <- mlb_hitting %>% filter(Tm == \"Philadelphia Phillies\")\npi <- mlb_pitching %>% filter(Tm == \"Philadelphia Phillies\")\nphils <- combined %>% filter(Tm == \"Philadelphia Phillies\")\n\nSimpleStandings %>% \n  gt() %>% \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"The Phillies were a mid-tier National League team in the 2022 regular season\",\n    subtitle = \"Philadelphia played just good enough to make the playoffs\"\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n)%>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) %>%\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Lucas Wilkinson  |  **Source:** [Sports Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/NL/2022-standings.shtml)\")\n  ) %>%\ntab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) %>%\n  opt_row_striping() %>% \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") %>%\n\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#002D72\"), \n      cell_text(color = \"#E81828\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Tm == \"Philadelphia Phillies\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      The Phillies were a mid-tier National League team in the 2022 regular season\n    \n    \n      Philadelphia played just good enough to make the playoffs\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Tm\n      W\n      L\n      GB\n    \n  \n  \n    Los Angeles Dodgers\n111\n51\n+24.0\n    Atlanta Braves\n101\n61\n+14.0\n    New York Mets\n101\n61\n+14.0\n    St. Louis Cardinals\n93\n69\n+6.0\n    San Diego Padres\n89\n73\n+2.0\n    Philadelphia Phillies\n87\n75\n--\n    Milwaukee Brewers\n86\n76\n1.0\n    San Francisco Giants\n81\n81\n6.0\n    Chicago Cubs\n74\n88\n13.0\n    Arizona Diamondbacks\n74\n88\n13.0\n    Miami Marlins\n69\n93\n18.0\n    Colorado Rockies\n68\n94\n19.0\n    Cincinnati Reds\n62\n100\n25.0\n    Pittsburgh Pirates\n62\n100\n25.0\n    Washington Nationals\n55\n107\n32.0\n  \n  \n    \n      By: Lucas Wilkinson  |  Source: Sports Reference\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nThe Phillies limped into the postseason this year as the sixth seed in the playoffs. The standings visually show how close the race was. However, the Phillies were not really a hot team to end the season. They went 7-13 in their last 20 games, and lost the last two games of the season. The Phillies finished 3rd place in the NL East.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=Stacked, \n    aes(x=reorder(Tm,Total), weight=Total, fill=Type)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#002D72\", \"#E81828\")) + \n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Wins\", \n    title=\"Phillies did not beat many quality \\n teams in the regular season.\", \n    subtitle=\"Philadelphia was near the bottom of the National League vs. teams >.500\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Lucas Wilkinson\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\" , \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank() \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Phillies also were not beating many teams above .500. I classified those wins as quality wins. Philadelphia was 34-47 against quality teams. I am still unsure how they were so bad against good teams until they reached the playoffs.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=combined, aes(x=ERA, y=BA)) +\n    geom_point(data=phils, aes(x=ERA, y=BA), color=\"#E81828\") +\n  coord_flip()+ \n  \n  geom_point(data=phils, aes(x=`ERA`, y=`BA`), color=\"#E81828\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=phils, aes(x=`ERA`, y=`BA`, label=\"Phillies\")) +\n    \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 3.96) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = .243) +\n  \n   labs(\n    x=\"ERA\", \n    y=\"Offensive Batting Average\", \n    title=\"Philadelphia was average in team ERA, \\nnot amazing at hitting.\", \n    subtitle=\"The Phillies had an okay regular season in many aspects.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Sports Reference | By Lucas Wilkinson\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8, face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10) \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nI correlated team ERA (pitching) and offensive batting average to see how Philadelphia matched up against every MLB team over the season. The black lines are league averages. The Phillies were right at average for team ERA, and just above the league average for team batting average. These stats are not the only way to define an offense and defense, but they are a good starting point.\nThe NLCS contained the fifth and sixth seeded teams. I don’t believe this should happen often, and if MLB wants to stay relevant they need their best teams playing late in the postseason. The 162 game season is starting to seem outdated. I believe the MLB should rethink either the regular season platform, or the postseason platform."
